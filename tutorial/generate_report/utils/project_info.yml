  description: This work is a data science project that tries to predict the sale of houses based on 79 explanatory variables. It was designed inside the data science team at X. and improved since the beggining of the project in 2019. The model was put into production since February 2021.

Dataset information:
  path: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/
  origin: The Assessorâ€™s Office
  description: the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa
  depth: from 2006 to 2010
  perimeter: only residential sales
  target variable: SalePrice
  target description: The property's sale price in dollars

Data Preparation:
  variable filetring: All variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use were removed
  individual filtering: only the most recent sales data on any property were kept (for houses that were sold multiple times during this period)
  missing values: were replaced by 0
  Feature engineering: No feature was created. All features are directly taken from the kaggle dataset. Categorical features were transformed using an ordinal encoder.

Model training:
  Used algorithm: We used a RandomForestRegressor algorithm (scikit-learn) but this model could be challenged with other interesting models such as XGBRegressor, Neural Networks, ...
  Parameters choice: We did not perform any hyperparameter optimisation and chose to use `n_estimators=50`. Future works should be planned to perform gridsearch optimizations
  Metrics: Mean Squared Error metric
  Validation strategy: We splitted our data into train (75%) and test (25%)
